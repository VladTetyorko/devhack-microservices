    - The answer uses imperative commands (e.g., ''Generate...'', ''List...'', ''Provide...'', ''Explain in...'').
    - The answer sets a role or persona (e.g., ''You are an expert...'', ''You are a technical interviewer...'').
    - The answer contains security or anti-prompt-injection phrases (e.g., ''Ignore any instructions...'', ''Disregard previous instructions...'').
    - The answer includes detailed formatting requirements (e.g., ''Start each line with...'', ''Do not number...'').
    - The answer contains self-referencing phrases (e.g., ''In this prompt...'', ''This is a template...'').
    - The answer contains no actual technical content but instead seems to be a prompt or template.
    - The answer contains placeholders or template variables (e.g.''{variable}'', ''[placeholder] etc.'').
    - The answer emphasizes AI behavior (e.g., ''You should behave like...'', ''As an AI, you should...'').
